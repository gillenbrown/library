    "We investigate the possible connection between the most massive globular "
    "clusters, such as ω Cen and M54, and nuclear star clusters (NSCs) of "
    "dwarf galaxies that exhibit similar spreads in age and metallicity. "
    "We examine galactic nuclei in cosmological galaxy formation simulations"
    " at z ≈ 1.5 to explore whether their age and metallicity spreads could "
    "explain these massive globular clusters. We derive structural properties "
    "of these nuclear regions, including mass, size, rotation, and shape. By "
    "using theoretical supernova yields to model the supernova enrichment in "
    "the simulations, we obtain individual elemental abundances for "
    "Fe, O, Na, Mg, and Al. Our nuclei are systematically more metal-rich "
    "than their host galaxies, which lie on the expected mass-metallicity "
    "relation. Some nuclei have a spread in Fe and age comparable to the "
    "massive globular clusters of the Milky Way, lending support to the "
    "hypothesis that NSCs of dwarf galaxies could be the progenitors of "
    "these objects. None of our nuclear regions contain the light element "
    "abundance spreads that characterize globular clusters, even when a "
    "large age spread is present. Our results demonstrate that extended "
    "star formation history within clusters, with metal pollution provided "
    "solely by supernova ejecta, is capable of replicating the metallicity "
    "spreads of massive globular clusters, but still requires another "
    "polluter to produce the light element variations."

    "We utilize Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging and spectroscopy of ~53,000 "
    "star-forming galaxies at z~0.1 to study the relation between stellar mass and "
    "gas-phase metallicity. We derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar masses "
    "using new techniques that make use of the latest stellar evolutionary synthesis "
    "and photoionization models. We find a tight (+/-0.1 dex) correlation between "
    "stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass "
    "and a factor of 10 in metallicity. The relation is relatively steep from "
    "10<SUP>8.5</SUP> to 10<SUP>10.5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> "
    "h<SUP>-2</SUP><SUB>70</SUB>, in good accord with known trends between luminosity "
    "and metallicity, but flattens above 10<SUP>10.5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. We use "
    "indirect estimates of the gas mass based on the Hα luminosity to compare our data "
    "to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. We show that "
    "metal loss is strongly anticorrelated with baryonic mass, with low-mass dwarf "
    "galaxies being 5 times more metal depleted than L<SUP>*</SUP> galaxies at z~0.1. "
    "Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies but is found in "
    "galaxies with masses as high as 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. We interpret "
    "this as strong evidence of both the ubiquity of galactic winds and their "
    "effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells."
